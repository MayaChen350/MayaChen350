# Inventory App

## Why?

It's hard to track where things are when you're often ending up rapidly moving things somewhere because you gotta leave some place for other things, like I do often  
So tracking them in an app for it could be nice 

## Description

This is a very old idea I had a time ago and tried doing it but yes, my idea was tracking things by like specific place within place, like `my room -> my closet -> first shelf or smth` kinda like a tree

## Tools to use probably

- A programming language
- A right mind

## When possible?

Anytime really, but when I'll have time that could be nice probably
