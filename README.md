Hi! I'm maya and I compile into yet another autistic transfem programmer

My favorite language is Kotlin :D

However all languages are valid (probably) so except for BF I really don't mind picking another language, and that anytime.

Feel free to contact me on discord (**@giratina_shiny**) or at maychennn@protonmail.com (but preferably we'll go on discord after)

I'm not very used to work with people yet but I'll be glad to work with you if you want a (very) cool (and silly) transfem coding friend / partner

I try to be versatile!! Here's some languages I know (or kinda):
\
C,
\
Python, Lua,
\
Java, C#, Kotlin,
\
Haskell,
\
Javascript, Typescript, (html css scss)
\
and Zig and I know some bf

I'm also familiar with Godot and gdscript.

Of course I'm very open if you have a language you want to introduce me in!!!

...Except Rust
\
Do I really need to...?
\
Aren't like most queer programmers Rust users anyway?? Can't I be original somehow!! Fine fine one day I'll learn it I guess!

Alsoooo don't be scared of approaching me if you're a beginner.

If you're motivated I'll be glad to talk to you about programming!

Here's my outdated bio website if you want to check too:
