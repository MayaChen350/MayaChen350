# Note tools to kinda link notes together

## Why?

I write notes. Notes are messy. I don't know where things are, they're not regrouped.  
But all those apps are annoying right? Can't I just have something I can use on the terminal?  
Not something fancy, no need for TUI, what about just something that input something so I can use `less` on it or even save it in a file?

## Description

Like the [Why] section described a little, this should be something kinda simple.  
No TUI, no fancy GUI, all in the terminal.

Basically, what I want the tool to do, is take all the notes from all the files in the folder, with notes formatted in a certain way (with tags)  
And with the tool, you can basically generate a structured file regrouping all the small notes from different files with the same tags together, kinda like how a linker puts everything in the .text section in the final executable/library in the same .text section.  

An additional editor or a n/vim plugin with autocomplete of already existing tags could also be nice.

## Tools to use probably

- A programming language
- A right mind

## When possible?

Whether I'll have enough time and motivation to makes this project possible.
