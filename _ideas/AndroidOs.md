# Android OS

## Why?

I installed Linux Fedora on my computer and now I feel at home on it.  
Why not having something I can feel I have control on, and that I won't complain about it everyday on my phone too?  

## Description

From how I described on August 22nd 2025,

An android os focused on Open source software, with preinstalled FOSS (of course, they're uninstallable, but finding your own *calculator app* yourself is just extra unecessary work most of the time for a phone, but I guess an empty build of the OS could be good too)  
Of course, I'll have made the job of finding good maintained, performant and *fancy* apps for when you choose to have preinstalled ones.

There'd be a "store" which acts as a kind of package manager, which you can use a keyboard to access, but of course, it should end up in something visual, but minimal.  
I don't want the kind of usual stores which seems completely bloated.  
Of course, there'll ONLY be FOSS things on there.

I'll include an option to add the Google Play Store if you don't want to get your own APK online, it's still your choice, but anyway the rest of the features should make this kinda okay for most.

Customization would also be something that would be very cool, so like some kind of easy and large customization, that you can also export.

Talking of exports, configurations should also be exportable.  
Nobody like writing on a PHONE KEYBOARD when you can literally just usually use some touch screen stuff, so of course, I'll allow the keyboard to edit the files  
But also a kind of usual configuration app a bit like `dconf editor`, but the settings WILL be exportable, in TEXT FILES, no binaries and all, you can all put your phone configs on a git repository without problems.

I also want some kind of integrated shell, but like I said, writing on a phone keyboard isn't really the best for most people (like me) so a kind of shell which has few touches to get and do what you want could be nice while also including a keyboard one or a keyboard mode.

Monitoring the apps in background, and what takes your battery, RAM, etc would be good  
And STRICT default permissions should be necessary

Unfortunately though, it's on Android, so it's still the kernel by Google, but I mean at least if all this can work, it could be awesome

## Tools to use probably

- Low level languages
- ARM Assembly (because I can)
- Android API and other stuff

## When possible?

One day
