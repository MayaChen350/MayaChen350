# The endless current of procrastination (Todos basically)

Hi! There are things that I should probably end up doing in my projects!

I usually keep my todos for my projects in my head or somewhere private like on my server but this can probably help too. Really though, I'm mostly putting this here in case you're reaaaaally bored, want to do me a service (for some reasons) or just are seeking for experience with something, or whatever your reason but yes...

Feel free to send PRs for those things! (Of course you can also send PRs for other things I guess just don't make something weird I guess)

Thanks

## Notes

I am **not asking or inciting you to work or help on my own projects**, especially because I obviously won't pay anyone, so do it if you want

However, that also applies to **non-devs**, if you're looking for an update on a project, whether it's stated here or not, please contact me on discord.  
I'll really appreciate the motivation it'll give me if people show they are interested
