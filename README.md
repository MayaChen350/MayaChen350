Some projects/ideas I would currently gladly accept learning and working on with you:
- A website
- A C# application (or library)
- An Unity game
- A game mod
- A discord bot (Any language if you work with me, otherwise I'll choose)
- Embedded systems (but it's a brand new obsession)
- Or anything really! I love learning new stuff
---
If I place that here it's because I'm crazy about programming/computer science and want to have some people I can share this with, whether they work with me or not, teach me or learn from me or just are interested in general in what I'm doing <3 (which is rarely wow but okay I work hard on multiple things)

I started in August 2023 so I gotta say I'm really into it

Me a beginner? Surely
But at least I accept my mistakes and devour any concept I don't understand for hours so you can consider me a genius maybe (jk)

Check my website for more informations about me I guess I spent some time on it
