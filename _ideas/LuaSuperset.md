# Lua superset language

## Why?

Lua syntax annoys me, and there's not much "expressive" syntax to be fun to work with (according to me and only me maybe).

## Description

It would be a language that transpiles to lua, that IS NOT A LISP, with { }, but its main features will be, syntaxic sugar and maybe some other compiler things.

- No more `local` keyword if possible, making variables outside a scope global and inside a scope local. Or maybe not. I may not know lua enough and be saying braindead things right now.
- Immutable variables. (like `var` or `val` or `const local`/`local const`)
- Expressions like `var variable = { var v = 1; 1 + 1 }` or `const local variable = { local v = 1; 1 + 1 }`

## Tools to use probably

- A programming language

## When possible?

Whenever it's useful
