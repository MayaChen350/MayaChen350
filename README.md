Some projects/ideas I would currently gladly accept learning and working on with you:
- A website
- A C# application (or library)
- A game mod
- A discord bot (Any language if you work with me, otherwise I'll choose)
- Or anything really! I love learning new stuff

Despite this and my obssession for learning more and becoming better, consider that I lack experience, like, I started *really* programming on mid August 2023. Starting there I've been doing a lot of C# with college, then started a kind of card game that I'm still working on on my part, I will make the repository public later.

After that by my friend's recommandation I started learning web. In one month and half I learned most html and css, and I started learning javascript recently.

Despite me sometimes being sad of not being able to do projects with anyone, I gotta recognize my level anyway, I'm just a beginner. However if you're here say hi to my discord I somehow lack socials ^^'
